After becoming inspired from some videos describing Conway's game of life. I decided to code up my own version. Eventually, I added interactivity and an option for 
logging stable forms. The stable form logging utility can be used to construct reward functions for initial state finder ML algorithms.

How to use:

Please press enter when prompted with "Go?"

Enter how many frames you want the simulation to run for when prompted with "iterations" 

A high number is usually more interesting!

Press space to unpause and begin the simulation, LEFT clicks in the simulation allow you to add lit-up/living squares!

RIGHT clicks delete squares!

You can pause it again with space to add squares with more precision. 

There are some other features such as restarting, adding iterations etc.

An algorithm that searches for specific patterns and logs their existance is optional and included in the code.
